<p>Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed by
Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family
by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino
Marini.</p>

<p>It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining
numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of
diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric
sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character
set.</p>

<p>It also has a sister family, <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway+Dots">Raleway Dots</a>.</p>
